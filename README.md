# Football-Analysis-System


## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing football match footage by detecting and tracking players, referees, and the ball using the YOLO object detection model. To enhance detection accuracy, the model is further trained on custom data. Players are grouped into teams based on the color of their jerseys using K-means clustering for pixel segmentation. This allows us to compute ball possession percentages for each team throughout the match.

To track player movement more precisely, optical flow is used to compensate for camera motion between frames. Perspective transformation is applied to convert pixel coordinates into real-world measurements, enabling the calculation of distances in meters. With this data, the system estimates each playerâ€™s speed and total distance covered during the match.
